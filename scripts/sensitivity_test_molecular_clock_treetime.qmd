## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Sensitivity testing

We want to try the effect of changing the Clock Standard deviation on the result of treetime

```{bash}
treetime --clock-rate 9.8e-4 --clock-std-dev 0.0005
treetime --clock-rate 9.8e-4 --clock-std-dev 0.001
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
